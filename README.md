# Morse_code-enigma
Operational basic Morse encoder and decoder with a delimiter concept.

## Aim
To create a program that converts the input into Morse Code and vice-versa
Concept: Using dictionary to contain the Key and value information (morse-code)

## How it works
#Encoding...
User is provided with operation choice whether to encode or decode.
After selecting the procedure, the user must enter a delimiter to make the output reusable as,reverse (decoding the morse is quite complex process)
Then user is said to enter the message to be encode with the selected delimiter.
Later the user is delivered with a success message and the encoded output.

#Decoding...
User selects the desired operation to decode from the welcome message.
In the process user must enter the same delimiter used by the Encoder(Sender) and later input the encoded message.
After providing input we get the decoded message.

# Usage
To create encrypted message. Usage of python language.
# Later Advancements
Concept of creating a Hash file to store the encoded information and making it easy sharable. To use a better delimiter concept and improve its theorized functionality.
## The end.
